## MISSING FILES from RNA_seq data

** trainingData.csv** contains the normalized RNA_seq data of all the transcripts for patient samples used in training. Due to the nature of the algorithm, a unique trainingData.csv file was created for each sequential convergence of the  biomarkers transcripts. In other words, the trainingData fie for the e0 convergence contains all transcript rows for all the training samples, and conv1 contains a subset of the e0 version, which will be almost identical minus the converge transcripts of the first iteration (approximately 53 sites). The trainingData.csv conv2 will contain an almost identical subset of the probes used in conv1 minus the converged transcripts (approximately 34 probes). The pattern continues until the 10th convergence.
